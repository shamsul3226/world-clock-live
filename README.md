# 🌍 World Live Clock

A beautifully crafted React + Vite web application that displays the live time across multiple countries. Designed with love, tweaked with intention, and inspired by the magic of fast prototyping.

## 🖼️ Overview

**World Live Clock** is a personal project born from rapid prototyping and passionate tweaking. It started as an illustration made in Canva, then transformed into code via [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) using Copilot-generated prompts. After integrating the generated code into GitHub and deploying with Vercel, I manually refined the UI, theme, and layout to match my vision of a clean and beautiful time zone tracker.
